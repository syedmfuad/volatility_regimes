# volatility_regimes
This simple R shiny app (currently undeployed, but fully functional) takes one or more ticker symbols as inputs and returns portfolio cumulative log return, cumulative return squared and volatility regimes. The inspiration for this project was from the blog posts by Robert J Frey (of the Renaissance Tech fame).

## Prerequisites
* An IDE for R (RStudio)
* Shiny (R library)

## Deployment
The webapp sources stock price data from the quantmod package which in turn uses the yahoo API. This is built-in the package and the user does not have to set API keys for access.

## Frontend - shiny app features
This app is perpetually updated and new features are added whenever possible and older features removed. As of August 2020, these are the current offerings.
